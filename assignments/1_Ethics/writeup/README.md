### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

Knowing the risks of not fixing the problem, there is no way that allowing the exploitation to not be handled is an option. 6 months of work and a team of 20 developers is the ultimate goal no matter what path I take. Because this is an internal company problem, there is no need for me to reach out to the public immediately without trying to solve it internally. Additionally, I don't think I could legally talk about issues that we have depending on the company's policies. The first thing I would do is go straight to my boss about the issue. I would expect him to hear out my proposition and go through with patching the exploitation. If he disagrees, then I would simply keep going up the chain, talking to his boss and so on. I would hope that eventually someone would make the right decision. If nobody is willing to postpone the ECU's release, then I really don't think there's anyone else I could probably tell legally. If I had done nothing than I would be responsible if I continued to let the exploitation live. However, having exhausted all my options, as much as I would blame myself I can't hold myself accountable for the negligence of the company.
